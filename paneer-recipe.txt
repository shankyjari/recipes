Directions

    Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat.
    Mix spices together and cook in oil until fragrant and cumin seeds turn a reddish brown.
    Stir in cabbage and toss to coat it with the spices, cook until slightly wilted 3-5 minutes.
    Stir in 1/2 cup water, tomato, paneer, and cilantro. Lower heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender and the cheese is spongy-soft (10-15 minutes). *The sauce will not thicken.
    Serve immediately.
